            <h1>- history</h1>
            <h2>In 1780, John Jameson established a way of making Irish whiskey that we’ve been proudly sticking to ever
                since.</h2>
            <p>As you can imagine, producing a blended Irish whiskey that has been enjoyed for over two centuries, takes
                a lot. But don’t worry, we’ve distilled over 200 years of courage, craft and a collective appreciation
                for taste, into one short account. So here’s the secret behind our signature smoothness – our process
                and our people.</p>
            <img id="history-img" src="img/jameson.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Twice as smooth, one of a kind</h2>
            <p>Jameson Irish Whiskey is a blended Irish whiskey. What’s that we hear you say. Well first we take the
                best of pot still and fine grain whiskeys. Then we triple distil them - not because we have to because
                we want to as it gives it its signature smoothness. Finally, we age them in oak casks for a minimum of 4
                years.</p>
            <p>Why do we do all that?</p>
            <h2>Taste, that's why.</h2>

            <h3 class="width1000">Triple distilled, twice charred, for a rich smooth taste.</h3>
            <p class="width1000">Charring is an age-old method for invigorating barrels to intensify the taste. Jameson
                Black Barrel is our tribute to our coopers, who painstakingly give their bourbon barrels an additional
                charring to reveal their untold richness and complexity. Because every barrel contains secrets; the
                trick is coaxing them out.</p>

            <p class="width1000">Back in the day it was common practice to sell Irish whiskey to bonders by the cask.
                Then, it was left up to them to bottle it. In 1963, after some greedy bonders started to water down the
                whiskey to fill up their pockets, we took over full control of the process, from grain to glass. Jameson
                Crested is a celebration of those first drops bottled back in Bow Street.</p>

                a whiskey that incorporates all the great flavours of an IPA. We matured Jameson Irish whiskey in Irish
                Pale Ale-seasoned barrels, and the end result is something people are calling the next great IPA…</p>

                the Head Brewer of a local craft beer brewery, started at the bar. A swapping of whiskey and beer
                barrels soon after, resulted in Jameson Caskmates Stout Edition - triple-distilled, blended Irish
                Whiskey that has been patiently finished in Irish craft beer-seasoned barrels.</p>
